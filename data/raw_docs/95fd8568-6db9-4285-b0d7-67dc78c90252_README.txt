Tourism ML Dashboard Project
============================

Contents:
- india_vacation_ml_dataset_with_youtube.csv  (original dataset copied)
- model_train.py   (train two ML models and save them to models/)
- clean_tourism.csv  (saved by model_train.py after preprocessing)
- models/  (rf_budget.pkl, rf_popularity.pkl saved here after running model_train.py)
- app.py  (Streamlit dashboard)
- requirements.txt

How to run:
1) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate   (Windows) or source .venv/bin/activate (mac/linux)

2) Install requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Train models (this creates models/ and clean_tourism.csv)
   python model_train.py

4) Run Streamlit app
   streamlit run app.py

Notes:
- The app expects clean_tourism.csv and models/ to exist (created by model_train.py).
- The app provides buttons to download the cleaned CSV and pickled models.
